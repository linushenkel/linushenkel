# Hi, I'm Linus 👋  
**Engineer | Developer | Geospatial & Simulation Enthusiast**

I combine engineering, software development and field data collection — bridging the gap between the physical and digital world.  
My work focuses on water, terrain, and environmental systems — from data capture with drones and sensors to simulation, visualization, and automation.
